# Tanzania Tourism Prediction
The Tanzanian tourism sector plays a significant role in the Tanzanian economy, contributing about 17% to the countryâ€™s GDP and 25% of all foreign exchange revenues. The sector, which provides direct employment for more than 600,000 people and up to 2 million people indirectly, generated approximately $2.4 billion in 2018 according to government statistics. Tanzania received a record 1.1 million international visitor arrivals in 2014, mostly from Europe, the US and Africa.

Tanzania is the only country in the world which has allocated more than 25% of its total area for wildlife, national parks, and protected areas.There are 16 national parks in Tanzania, 28 game reserves, 44 game-controlled areas, two marine parks and one conservation area.

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict what a tourist will spend when visiting Tanzania.The model can be used by different tour operators and the Tanzania Tourism Board to automatically help tourists across the world estimate their expenditure before visiting Tanzania.

## Requirements:
- pyenv with Python: 3.9.4

### Environment

Use the requirements file in this repo to create a new environment.

```BASH
make setup 

#or 

pyenv local 3.9.4
python -m venv .venv
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If You encounter errors related to statsmodels, try:

```BASH
OPENBLAS="$(brew --prefix openblas)" pip install numpy statsmodels
```
</br>

## The automation script will be added later:
## Usage

In order to train the model and store test data in the data folder and the model in models run:

```bash
#activate env
source .venv/bin/activate

python train.py  
```

In order to test that predict works on a test set you created run:

```bash
python predict.py models/linear_regression_model.sav data/X_test.csv data/y_test.csv
```

## Limitations

development libraries are part of the production environment, normally these would be separate as the production code should be as slim as possible
